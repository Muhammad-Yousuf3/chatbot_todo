# Spec Architect Skill

## Purpose
Ensure all specifications are precise, scoped, and implementation-agnostic.

## Instructions
- Clearly define scope and non-scope
- Specify inputs, outputs, invariants, and constraints
- Describe system behavior, not code
- Avoid implementation details entirely
- Assume a project-wide constitution exists and must be followed
- Prefer clarity over verbosity

## Structure to Use
- Overview
- Goals
- Non-Goals
- Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements
- Constraints
- Open Questions (if any)

## Do NOT
- Write code
- Write plans or tasks
- Make assumptions without stating them

## Examples of Use
- "Write a specification for a stateless chat API"
- "Define the MCP task tool contract"
- "Create a database model specification"
