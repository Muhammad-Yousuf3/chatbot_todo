# System Planner Skill

## Purpose
Convert specifications into a clear technical strategy without writing tasks or code.

## Instructions
- Break the system into components
- Describe responsibilities and boundaries
- Explain data flow and interactions
- Document key design decisions and trade-offs
- Ensure alignment with stateless and MCP-based architecture
- Reference the originating specification explicitly

## Output Expectations
- Logical sequencing
- Clear component responsibilities
- Explicit assumptions
- Identified risks and mitigations

## Do NOT
- Write code
- Create task lists
- Change the original specification

## Examples of Use
- "Plan the MCP server architecture"
- "Design the chat request lifecycle"
- "Explain how agent, API, and database interact"
